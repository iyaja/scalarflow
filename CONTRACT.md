## Communication

**Team meetings**

1. Meetings will be held via Discord calls, or another platform if agreed upon by the team. 
2. Meetings are expected to last between one and two hours, and will take place at least twice a week.
3. Each meeting will have its own topic that was decided beforehand, and the project’s progress and issues will be reviewed. Meetings will be documented for future references.
4. The group will clearly describe the topic of discussion before starting the call.
5. Meeting notes will be taken for future reference. These notes may include statements made by the members of the team.
6. The team will use when2meet to plan meeting times and coordinate across timezones. Members are expected to fill in or communicate their preferences at least 24 hours before the meeting time.

**Assistance**

1. We will use discord as our primary source of contact. Response for assistance is expected to be immediate (within one to two hours), but this could be up to fifteen hours due to the differing time zone. Every teammate is expected to assist and support others.
2. While not enforceable, as a general rule, members should spend at least 15 minutes on a problem before asking the team for help.
3. Members should ask for help when required to ensure that their tasks are completed on time.


**Respect**

1. Each member should participate in decision makings. Whether it was to suggest ideas with ideas and/or supporting other teammate’s ideas. To ensure this, we will make final decisions through democratic methods such as voting and/or open discussions during team meetings. If a tie occured during voting, 
2. Members are expected to listen to, acknowledge, and carefully consider ideas and methods proposed by all other members in the team.


## Collaboration

**Work Distribution**

1. Participation is expected of every member in the team.
2. Workload will be distributed accounting for each member’s capacity, but each member will have a role in each step of the project’s progress. The workload will generally be divided into four parts for each member to have something to work on.
3. To minimize unexpected complications and unforeseen work, workload planning and distribution will be done during team meetings prior to working on them. Planning and distribution of tasks will consider each task’s effort and difficulty.
4. During team meetings, we will assign specific tasks to each member, to be completed by a specific day. This information will be logged in a project management tool of the team’s choosing. Members are expected to complete the tasks on time if it has been properly assigned and agreed upon.

**Time Commitment**

1. Every member is expected to spend at least ten hours on the project (potentially fewer if they are able to finished the assigned tasks in a shorter amount of time).
2. Team meetings will occur to review the week’s progress and prepare for the upcoming week. If a teammate has other urgent activities that could potentially hinder their ability to finish their tasks, they should inform the team as soon as they possibly can, and the team will find a way to finish their remaining tasks.

**Conflict resolution**

1. Final decisions regarding the project will be determined by voting. For any voting procedure, three votes (or more) out of four in the team automatically wins. In the case of an even split, the team will consult a third party (professor, project mentor, or course staff).
