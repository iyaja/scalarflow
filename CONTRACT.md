## Communication

### Team meetings

1. The meeting time depends on the time zone of each teammates. Most of teammates are supposed have spare time on weekends. 

   (I don’t think the above paragraph is necessary. We could either come up with an exact time and day and put it here, or not put it at all in the team contracts if we haven’t decided. They didn’t tell us to specify what time these meetings will occur so those details are not mandatory, I think?)

2. We decide to have meetings 3 times per week and each meeting will last 1-2 hours depending on the team's situation and priority of topic of the meeting. 
3. We could use zoom or teams to host these meetings depending on the preference of most of our teammates. 
4. Before each meeting starts, we are supposed to have some valuable topic to discuss and review the progress and issues of final project. Email is also a way to contact the teammates. But it’s actually quite slow and the person who come up with the question couldn’t get response in time. Besides that, we could discuss some important topics like specific implementation of the data structure. 
5. (Meetings will be held with either zoom or teams. We will have at least one, and up to three meetings every week, and each meeting will be one to two hours long depending on team member’s situation and/or the topic of the meeting. 
6. Each meeting will have its own topic that was decided beforehand, and the project’s progress and issues will be reviewed. Meetings will be documented for future references.) 

### Assistance

1. The most convenient way to contact any of the teammates should be through discord. Because discord provides some features like phone call to strengthen the communication between teammates. The teammates are expected to give response within one or two hours depending on their situation. 
2. (We will use discord as our primary source of contact. Response for assistance is expected to be immediate (within one to two hours), but this could be up to eight hours due to the differing time zone. Every teammate is expected to assist and support others.) 

 

### Respect

1. Every team member is expected to come up with the idea. Every team member should be involved in every large decision of final project. Every team member has different personality. We should use different ways to communicate with each other. For example, we could make decisions through voting or open discussions during the team meetings. 

2. Every teammate is expected to come up with at least a topic of before each team meeting. Every teammate is supposed to support other teammates’ initiative or not to support. But if the teammate doesn’t support any teammates’ initiative, this teammate is supposed to come up with an initiative. 

3. (Participation is expected of every teammate. Each member should participate in decision makings; whether it was to suggest ideas with ideas and/or supporting other teammate’s ideas. To ensure this, we will make final decisions through democratic methods such as voting and/or open discussions during team meetings.) 

 

## Collaboration

### Work Distribution

1. Workload should be distributed depends on the teammate’s own willing and capacity.

2. The simplest way to distribute the workload is to divide workload into four parts according to number of teammates. 

3. In order to deal with the unexpected complications or unforeseen work, we should make plan of each week. And before starting doing the task of the week, we should discuss on the team meeting and figure out what kind of tasks should be finished in the week and estimate each task’s effort which should be taken in accordance to [software development effort estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_effort_estimation).

4. The teammate who come up with a lot of ideas should support other teammates because of other teammates’ knowledge limitation. 

5. In the end, each teammates’ workload should be approximately equal. 

6. (Workload will be distributed prioritizing each member’s capacity, but each member will have a role in each step of the project’s progress. The workload will generally be divided into four parts for each member to have something to work on. 

7. To minimize unexpected complications and unforeseen work, workload planning and distribution will be done during team meetings prior to working on them. Planning and distribution of tasks will consider each task’s effort using the software development effort estimation.) 

### Time Commitment

1. Each group member is expected to spend at least 10 hours on the final project. Before each week starts, there should be enough time to prepare the topic of team meeting of next coming week and review the progress (code, design, idea) of this week. 

2. If some of teammates’ other activities conflict with the final project, the teammate should inform other teammates and ensure to find the backup to do the remaining task. 

3. (Every member is expected to spend at least ten hours on the project. Team meetings will occur to review the week’s progress and prepare for the upcoming week. If a teammate has other urgent activities that could potentially hinder their ability to finish their tasks, they should inform the team as soon as they could, and the team will find a way to finish their remaining task.) 

### Conflict resolution

1. Each result of large decision of final project should come from voting of teammates. Teammates who can’t finish their tasks on time should inform other teammates immediately and seek for help of others as early as possible. 

2. Before each team meeting starts, there should be one teammate reminding other teammates through email or discord. 

3. (Final decisions regarding the project will be determined by voting. If a teammate is unable to finish their tasks on time, they should inform the team and seek help from others as soon as possible. Attendance in team meetings is expected, and there will be a teammate giving a reminder before each meeting.)
