# Final Project Development

## Week 1 (Nov 22-29)

### Graph Implementation
- Created the basic graph objects such as Edge, Vertex, and Graph class
- Created `Random` class to create a predictable pattern for testing
- Implemented basic compute function capable of computing basic operations such as additions and multiplications.

## Week 2 (Nov 30- Dec 6)

### Parser
- Created grammar for computational graph specification language
- Implemented basic space-delimitted parser for graph language

## Week 3 (Dec 7-12)

### Graph Implementation
- Refactored Graph class to better support the parser
- Implemented DFS and BFS for graph traversals
- Implemented forward propogation
- Implemented reverse-mode evaluation
