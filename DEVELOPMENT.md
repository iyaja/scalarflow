# Final Project Development

## Week 1 (Nov 22 - Nov 29)

### Graph Implementation
- Create basic graph library classes such as Edge, Vertex, and Graph class
- Create `Random` class to create a predictable pattern for testing
- Implement basic compute function capable of computing basic operations such as additions and multiplications.

### Graph Algorithms
- Implement basic forward propogation algorithm with a limited set of operators

### Parser & Executable
- Evaluate ONNX specification for graph grammar
- Create simple grammar for computational graph specification language

## Week 2 (Nov 30 - Dec 6)

### Parser & Executable
- Implement basic space-delimitted parser for graph language

## Week 3 (Dec 7 - Dec 12)

### Parser & Executable
- Remove grammar specification and implement simple lexer for flexibility
- Add more output information for binary

### Graph Implementation
- Major refactoring of graph class from latest cs255 lab

### Graph Algorithms
- Refactor DFS and BFS for graph traversals
- Refactor forward propogation
- Implement reverse-mode evaluation
