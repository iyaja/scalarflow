# Final Project Development

## Week 1
Created the basic neccesary objects such as Edge, Vertex, and Graph class for the project, as well as a Random class to create a predictable pattern for testing. The graph is capable of computing basic operations such as additions and multiplications. Currently, we are attempting to create the data sets to be implemented to the graph.
